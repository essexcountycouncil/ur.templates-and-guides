# Essex County Council user research templates and guides #

Here you'll find templates and guides you can use for conducting user research at the council. 

We've created this space to make documents available to council staff as well as those who may be conducting research in other councils or organisations. 


## Make theses templates your own ##

Adapt these templates and guides and make them your own. If working outside the council please remove Essex County Council's logo.

## Let us know what you think ##

The documents are still a work in progress and we hope to add more templates and guides.
